Through <strong>over-the-air</strong> udpates.\nIt’s the ability of an app to receive bugfixes and new features that can be applied at runtime and refresh the experience to the user. This means no store approval, no build time and lots of other simplifications.</p>\n<h2>General inner working</h2>\n<p>Clearly I won’t talk about other platforms, but OTA updates aren’t possible on every framework due to their different inner workings.\nIn React Native we are “required” to build a <strong>JavaScript bundle</strong> in order to produce a production app. That js bundle, called index.android.bundle in Android and main.jsbundle in iOS, is bundled within the aab/apk/ipa and then the Java/Obj-C code of React Native will “just” talk to that.\nSo how are OTA delivered? Simple, replacing that bundle, when certain conditions are met, through a native linked library and restarting the execution of that bundle at runtime.</p>\n<p>Now understanding how something works is the only way you can improve yourself and become as independent as possible. I might also have tempted a personal implementation of this mechanism, but it’d be silly since we have Microsoft CodePush: a tool, inside the app center, made exactly to deliver OTA updates.</p>\n<h2>Configuration</h2>\n<p>Online resources are a bit scarse on how to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Properly configure this library</li>\n<li>How to use the appcenter cli</li>\n<li>How to use the <a href=\"http://appcenter.ms/\">appcenter.ms</a> website dashboard</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/\">huge unhandy microsoft documentation</a> about it, but at the same time it’s possible to find many commands out in the wild of the old version of the cli that don’t works anymore.</p>\n<h2>Linking</h2>\n<p>the following</p>\n<h2>Important CLI commands</h2>\n<p>Now an handy collection of the main useful commands you can refer to</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">DEPLOY (to a deployment name)\nappcenter codepush release-react -a &lt;owner&gt;/&lt;appName&gt; -d &lt;deploymentName&gt; -t vesion\n\nLIST APPS FOR CURRENT USER\nappcenter apps list\n\nADD A DEPLOYMENT (to an app)\nappcenter codepush deployment add -a {owner}/{appName} Staging\n\nLIST DEPLOYMENTS AND KEYS (of an app)\nappcenter codepush deployment list -a {owner}/{appName} --displayKeys\n\nDELETE ALL EXISTING DEPLOYS (of a deployment name)\nappcenter codepush deployment clear -a &lt;ownerName&gt;/&lt;appName&gt; &lt;deploymentName&gt;\n\nDELETE A SPECIFIC DEPLOY (of a deployment name)</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you need any kind of support, reach out to me on twitter, I’d be glad to help.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"blog/microsoft-codepush-integration-in-react-native-0.60","title":"Microsoft CodePush Integration in React Native 0.60+","date":"November 21, 2019","description":"Microsoft CodePush is a powerful tool but can be very exhausting to configure.
