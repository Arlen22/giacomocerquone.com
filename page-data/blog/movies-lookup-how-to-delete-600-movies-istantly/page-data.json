I was really annoyed of this situation: in fact I’m well known to be extremely minimalist and a damn control freak… my rommate knows this very very well, in my family’s house I used to throw out the impossible and everytime I put things in order I come out with plenty of full bags of garbage, it’s a lifestyle.\nFor this reason I had to do the same thing with the movies that were stored in the NAS that I built almost two years ago (don’t worry if you’re bored, you’ll be even more when I’ll do a post for that too). So one afternoon a few days ago I was in my dad’s car to go back to my university’s house and since I was bored I started developing this very little thing right in the car. The trip took one hour and for the time I was arrived I had already a first version of the app.</p>\n<h2>So what did you do and why?</h2>\n<p>So there were these movies that I kept for a long time for no reason, I started to watch a big part of them quite some time ago and I noticed that a lot of them were crap and a lot of others were not so much good to deserve to use my gigabytes so I decided to create something that could fastly show me (all together) info, ratings and trailers of all the movies, and the ones that hadn’t a certain minimum rating were highlighted.</p>\n<p>If you want to take a look to the code <a href=\"http://github.com/giacomocerquone/Movies-Lookup.git\">here is the github repo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/movies-lookup\">here the npm page</a>, and now follows a screen of what it is (read the final notes to know why it’s so ugly):</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;
